35mmArena

The 35mm Arena provides a circular, 35mm diameter, fly arena with recording capbilities. Seven microphones provide coverage for the entire arena. The circuitry is the same design used in the 96 channel FlySong rig, so one 35mm arena can be plugged into one of the 96 channel backplane connectors and use the same software to record audio.
